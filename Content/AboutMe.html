    <T>About Me</T>
    <c1> My career path has encompassed a variety of fields, including material science, architecture and industrial design.
        I've done research on the fabrication of thin film, low temperature aluminum superconductors under Professor Nina Markovic,
        Architectural design at PRESENT Architecture and product design with additive manufacturing at Studio Bitonti. I've led innovation based
        projects involving the additive production of wearable technology, the manufacturing of polymer compounds and the generation of blended
        auxetic structures. I've also led a variety of design projects, including a tech dress featured during New York Fashion Week, prosthetic
        leg covers, 3D printed footwear and a scoliosis brace that was acquired by the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My sincere belief is that a design is only as good as the concept that ignited it, and the best concepts originate at the intersection
        between multiple fields. To reach me directly, please email me at <b>wildfeuer.peter@gmail.com</b>
